# The New-Matrix-Library (NML)   
## While writitng this library i followed the tutorial from [Andrei Ciobanu](https://www.andreinc.net/2021/01/20/writing-your-own-linear-algebra-matrix-library-in-c)

This library is a personal project of mine to learn more about linear algebra and get more into rust-programming.
You can also find the Library on [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/nml-matrix) and add it to your projects with the cargo package manager.
